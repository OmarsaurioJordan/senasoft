Half-length portrait of a 40-year-old man with a thick black beard and long wild Afro-Caribbean hair, medium tan complexion (not too dark). His face resembles a Warcraft orc â€” strong jaw, protruding tusks, heavy brow, and a fierce scowl that gives him a rugged, intimidating look. He wears tribal shaman attire decorated with plants, tusks, bones, and natural ornaments. On his back is a steampunk-inspired backpack built from wood, copper, and brass, filled with analytical devices: old calculators, notebooks full of scribbled notes, statistical charts, magnifying lenses, and gears. His physique is powerful and sturdy, but not exaggeratedly muscular. Expression: stern and intimidating, yet wise. Style: digital comic art mixed with caricature-like illustration, vibrant colors, sharp lines, semi-realistic details, high resolution, 4K, square (1:1) composition. 

Negative prompt: blurry, low-res, watermark, extra limbs, overly grotesque or deformed anatomy, hyper-realistic sci-fi weapons, modern gadgets (phones, laptops), overly shiny or metallic armor, cartoonish proportions without detail, yellowish or oversaturated skin tones, background clutter.
